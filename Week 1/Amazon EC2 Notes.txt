Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It's designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment, and it allows you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment, manage your networkâ€™s access permissions, and run your image by using as many or few systems as you want.
