Amazon S3 Notes
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) stores data as objects within resources that are called buckets. You can store as many objects as you want within a bucket, and you can write, read, and delete objects in your bucket. Objects can be up to 5 TB in size.

You can control access to both the bucket and the objects (who can create, delete, and retrieve objects in the bucket for example), and view access logs for the bucket and its objects. You can also choose the AWS Region where a bucket is stored to optimize for latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.

With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. There is no minimum fee. Estimate your monthly bill by using the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator. We charge less where our costs are less, and prices are based on the location of your Amazon S3 bucket.
